1. Create some tests (at least one per function) that you want your Binary Search Tree (BST) to pass before you start coding.

Assume that left side is always less than previous node and right side is always greater than previous node... 

Add Function Test: Check that node is in correct position by starting at root of tree and printing every value until the newly added node. Use a combination of either in-order and post-order or in-order and pre-order traversals to figure out the shape of the tree. We can then see if the printed values match our rules of left and right. 

Remove Function Test: Print out the whole tree and check if given node was removed. Use a combination of either in-order and post-order or in-order and pre-order traversals to figure out the actual shape of the tree. We can then see if the printed values match our rules of left and right. 

Tree Traversal Function Test: We can draw out our expected tree and its printed values. We then can compare those values and see if they match up with the transversal function.

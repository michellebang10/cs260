Assignment 2 (Design)

Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:

1) What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?
- Enqueue (add element to back)
- Dequeue (remove element from front)
- Read data anywhere from the queue
- Double ended queue (add from front, remove from back)
2) What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?
- Pointer (how to link objects together)
- The type of data used
- Where the front and back of queue is

Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):

1) What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?
- Append (add elements to front or back)
- Insert (add element to specific position, maybe rewrite/overwrite value in position)
- Remove element 
2) What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?
- Pointer (how to link objects together)
- The type of data used
- The beginning and end of list
